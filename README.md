# Django-cats-CRUD-app
This Django project is to build a fully working CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application to manage cats and their breeds. These are the two models that are migrated to the database. I used Django-provided features for login and log-out. 
What User can do?
Log in to the application
Go to the main page to list all the cats
Add a new breed
View all the breeds
Update a breed
Add a new cat
View all the cats
Update a cat
Delete a cat
View all the breeds
Delete a breed
